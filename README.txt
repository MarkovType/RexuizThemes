How to create a theme :

    To create your .pk3 file, simply follow the hierarchy in "0_final-packages/zzz-rexdlc_menu_theme_cyberquake".
    You need to zip both the "gfx" directory and the "rexdlc_menu_theme_rexuiz.serverpackage" file (don't zip the parent directory).
    The folder in "gfx/menu" must be named after your package name.
